Deep learning concepts have been gaining spotlight in the world of computer science and its advancements in recent years. Among the many applications of Deep Learning Neural networks which have gained a lot of attention in the computer science community is the advancement of visual applications by using said Neural Networks and their methodology.
Image Captioning is one of such visual applications which is achieved using Deep Learning. This involves Deep Learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which are used for image feature extraction and Natural Language Processing respectively. This project has many real-world applications, and we can use this model as a steppingstone to explore other applications using Computer Vision. We can expect a minimum accuracy of the captions generated of an image to be 70% and can work on the model to increase its accuracy to a higher extent.
